            <p class="yellow"> This is a guide to downloading most games online totally free of cost
                I have few ways to download games.all of them are easy.
                FIRST STEP IS TO DOWNLOAD A TORRENT APPLICATION
                ( i.e Utorrent or Bittorrent )</p>
                <p class="yellow">For bit torrent click this link
                   <a href="#">BitTorrent Classic</a> 
                    For u torrent click this link
                    <a href="#">µTorrent (uTorrent) Classic </a></p>
                    <p class="yellow">After you download and install any ONE of above application we can move to next step
                        The next step is knowing where to download from </p>
                    <p class="yellow">Some of my regular use website are:</p>
<div class="contentcenter red">
<p>1. <a href="#">FitGirl Repacks</a> </p>
<p>2. <a href="#">STEAMUNLOCKED » Free Steam Games Pre-installed for PC</a></p>
<p>3. <a href="#">Torrent Search Engine | 1337x.to</a></p>
<p>4. <a href="#">Ocean of Games</a></p>
<p>It is ranked on the basis of download speed and availability of the games and ofc my own personal preference.</p>
</div>
<p class="yellow">I will go specifically on two website and how to download game from them 
    First  one is fitgirl repacks.</p>
    <div class="contentcenter red">
<p>1. Go to search button and type the name of the game you want to download</p>
<p>2. open the game by clicking on its icon</p>
<p>3. look for download mirror and click button [magnet] mostly placed at right side of 1337x</p>
<p>4. it will open your torrent application.The feature of fitgirl is that it lets you do selective   download that is it lets you select which languages you would like to select.if you are like me you will only download english language for most games.it helps to save a load of bandwidth on your network.and your storage on your pc too </p>
<p>5. click OK then it will download automatically in background</p>
<p>6. after the download is complete go to windows settings from start menu button.search virus & threat protection.it will open a new tab windows security</p>
<p>7.  Look for virus and threat protection settings and click manage settings.</p> 
<p>8. Real-time protection and turn it off .(if you have any antivirus go to that antivirus setting and seach for real time protection and turn it off)</p>
<p>9. now all the preparation are done.</p>
<p>10.  Open the downloaded game folder and you will see a read me.txt file open it and follow the instruction properly</p>
    </div>

<p class="green">After the installation is complete, enjoy the game</p>
